This is my NixOS Hyprland config for my FW16 laptop, based on [Zaneyos 2.x](https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos/-/tree/main?ref_type=heads).
Much was customized.
- [ ] TODO: fix wallsetter / swww script. Currently it doesn't work anymore, need to find out what happened or how to fix it. 
- [x] TODO: Wallsetter script fix implemented, #problem was the script not swww.
Some things that were broken with updates are commented out in the configs, it didn't seem to have much impact on looks or functinality, so no need to change anything for now.

How does this Hyprland nix configuration look:
